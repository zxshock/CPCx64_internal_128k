Requires a second bank to be piggybacked on top of the existing DRAMs. Various signals have to be taken from various chips on the board. Names according to the original schematic by Amstrad.
This has been tested on a german CPC464 with DD-1 and 6128 ROM. I see no reason why it shouldn't work on a 664 either - but this is untested from my side.
